### Formula - notes to a writer.

For you, the one with the dream to be heard. It's a cluttered world with endless information. How do you break through?

It's not hard. You don't need experience.

What you need is desire. When a desire burns so strong, it can't help but come out. This advice is for writers, but it's so much more. What I'm describing is action that comes from within.

To you, searching for prose that moves the reader.

Leave your computer behind and go to a quite space. Relax and let your mind open. Allow the breath to render. Close your eyes and shut off the chatter in your brain. Attune with the goal you seek. This is your key.

The door can now open.

Now ask for what you want. Ask for the inspiration to make you into the person you're meant to be. Maybe it's not a writer. Maybe it's not anything you know of yet.

Be patient.

If you're meant to write books, you'll write them. Embrace the soul within that holds your gift. Think less about your opinion that it must happen today. It's not meant to happen today. Show up and make the effort anyway.

The formula for all you want is simple, yet many are unaware.

**Thoughts = Words = Actions**

Become one with this trio and all you desire will flow into existence faster than you can imagine.

It's not your job to try harder. It's your job to allow what's already there.

### Thoughts

What do you desire? The first thing that comes to mind is a thought. That is the seed.

How often do you think of what you want?

In this case, writing. You think alot about writing. You think you have a calling to share your message with the world. You have grand ideas about the impact you will make.

Thinking creates reality. Everything placed in your life is in direct proportion to the thoughts you've had.

You've taken steps to train your thoughts, so why aren't they appearing?

That's a good word,_appear_.

Let's pretend you're in a field and cannot see anything. Suddenly, a beetle_appears_. Who's to say the beetle hasn't been there the whole time?

The same is true for what you desire. It's in front of you. You just can't see it yet.

As you work the formula, things relating to your desire will_appear_.

### **Words**

Be careful of the words you speak.

Words have creative power. When words are in line with your thoughts, your nature is in blossom. When words contradict your thoughts, you play in ridged standstill.

When your friends haircut is ugly and you tell them it looks good, you are contradicting your essence. Do you do this on a larger scale?

If thoughts and words don't align, you constrict the nectar of life from filling your cup.

### Action

Now that you have thoughts and words together, what actions are you taking?

Words are the nourishment for the seeds of thought. Action is the opening of the plant. It is movement toward the desired goal. It doesn't have to be right movement.

Imperfect action trumps doing nothing.

Think and talk all you want about writing the next_Walden_, but if no action is behind it, can there be an outcome?

Through action the beetle_appears_.

Once you master this formula, anything is attainable.

**Think, say, do.**

When these are in accordance, the world moves FOR you.

Synchronicity takes place.

You'll be in awe of how things are coming into existence. You'll become the eager observer to a life you consciously create.

You really can have the life of your dreams.

You first must_think_to dream it.
